/*
 * postdist, put the freshly built AppImage where it actually gets run.
 *
 * The suite is portable: `GameManagerConfig/` lives BESIDE the AppImage, not in ~/.config.
 * So the AppImage and its library are a pair, and dropping a new build into a directory that
 * has no config beside it produces a build that opens on an empty library, which is exactly
 * what had been happening on the Omarchy laptop, where every `npm run dist` landed in
 * ~/Games/Clarity (two AppImages, no config) while the real 930-game library sat in
 * ~/Clarity next to yesterday's build.
 *
 * Hence: deploy next to the config, rather than to a path that happens to be typed here.
 * Candidates are tried in order and the first one with a GameManagerConfig wins; if none has
 * one, the first that exists at all is used, which keeps a fresh machine working. Nothing is
 * created, this step is a convenience and must never be the thing that fails a build.
 *
 * ⚠️ Machine-specific paths. CLARITY_DEPLOY_DIR overrides everything, which is the
 * escape hatch for a machine that keeps its library somewhere else entirely.
