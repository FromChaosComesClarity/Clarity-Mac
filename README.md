> **This is the macOS fork.**
>
> Forked from [Clarity](https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/Clarity) at **v1.15.3**. That
> repository remains the Linux edition and continues independently; this one carries the macOS
> work and the two are expected to diverge over time.
>
> Nothing here is merged back. If a fix belongs to both, apply it to each deliberately.

> | | |
> |---|---|
> | Linux edition | https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/Clarity |
> | Fork point | `v1.15.3` (`9c2f91b`) |
> | Compatibility layer | CrossOver, not Proton |
> | Shared user data | `~/Library/Application Support/clarity` — the app name and bundle id are deliberately unchanged, so an existing library keeps working |

### Installing a release
>
macOS blocks these builds on first open and offers no "Open Anyway" button, because they are
ad-hoc signed rather than notarised. After dragging the app to `/Applications`:

```console
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Clarity Game Manager.app"
```

See [docs/gatekeeper-note.md](docs/gatekeeper-note.md); `scripts/release-mac.mjs` appends it
to every release automatically.


Every game you own, Steam, GOG, Epic, itch, PICO-8, emulators, fan games, source ports and
mods, in one place. One AppImage, three faces, no cloud, no launcher farm.

**2.0 is what this is becoming.** What you can download today is used daily on the machine it
is built on, and still rough in places. There is no date on 2.0.

macOS builds are attached to the same release, one version behind, because the Mac cannot be
packaged from Linux.

## The three faces

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **The Manager** | the desk | Import, organise, scrape, install, launch. Mouse and keyboard. |
| **Couch** | the sofa | Fullscreen, gamepad-first, made for a television across a room. |
| **Installer** | underneath | Installs GOG and Epic games headlessly, with no store client. |

## Get it

Download `Clarity.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/Clarity/releases),
make it executable, run it.

```bash
chmod +x Clarity.AppImage
./Clarity.AppImage              # the Manager
./Clarity.AppImage --couch      # the couch face
```

Your library, artwork and settings live in a folder beside the AppImage. Portable, backed up by
copying it, gone when you delete it.

## On Omarchy

There is a [companion plugin](https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/omarchy-clarity):
a bar widget showing what is installed and what is playing, and a launcher overlay, type a few
letters, press Enter, play. The app reads your actual Omarchy theme, opens games fullscreen on
the screen you chose, and stays out of the way otherwise.

## Build it

```bash
npm install
npm run dist        # → dist/Clarity.AppImage
```

Needs Node 22. `npm run dist:mac` builds the macOS pair, and only runs on a Mac.

## Documentation

The manual ships **inside the app**, under Menu → Manual. Deeper notes on the port catalogue,
per-game fixes and the macOS build live in [`docs/`](docs/) and on the
[website](https://fromchaoscomesclarity.github.io/ClarityWebSite/).

## Support it

- **Ko-fi:** <https://ko-fi.com/clarity>
- **PIX (Brazil):** `b734a9e2-e479-42f9-abd6-c88d1b8b880e`

Starring the repo and reporting what breaks counts too.
