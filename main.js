 * Clarity, unified suite entry point.
 *
 * One Electron process, three faces, dispatched by argv:
 *   (default)              → Manager  (Clarity)      windowed library hub
 *   installer <subcommand>   → Installer  engine/GUI   [wired in Phase 1]
 *   --couch | --fullscreen → Couch    fullscreen   [wired in Phase 3]
 *
 * Each face owns its own app identity (app.setName) so the one that runs in a
 * given process resolves the correct userData / single-instance lock. The
 * Installer face uses 'clarity-installer' so its CLI (launch/install/uninstall-headless/
 * setup) and data dir stay separate from the Manager's.
