Clarity 1.1.0

A small, focused release: Clarity now opens **straight to a game**.

## What's new

**`--game=<id>` deep-links.** Launch the suite with `--game=<id>` and The Manager opens directly on that game's page instead of the library, and if it's already running, the open window navigates there rather than a second copy starting up.

```sh
./Clarity.AppImage --game=753    # opens straight to that game
```

The desk-clock companion, [**ClarityClock**](https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/ClarityClock), is the first to use it: the game name on its slideshow is now clickable and brings you here, to that exact game.

Everything else from 1.0 is unchanged, same database, same 92 themes, same three faces.

## Install

1. Download `Clarity.AppImage` below
2. `chmod +x Clarity.AppImage`
3. Run it

Upgrading from 1.0.0? Just replace the AppImage. Your `GameManagerConfig` folder, your entire library, is untouched.

```sh
./Clarity.AppImage            # The Manager, the desktop library hub
./Clarity.AppImage --couch    # Couch, fullscreen, gamepad-first
./Clarity.AppImage installer    # Installer, the GOG/Epic engine
```

## Notes

- Linux only. The suite ships as a single AppImage; there are no Windows or macOS builds.
- The About dialog now reads 1.1.0.

## Spread the good vibes

If Clarity got your gaming life together, consider sending a little support my way. It keeps the good vibes flowing. *"stay positive and love your life."*
