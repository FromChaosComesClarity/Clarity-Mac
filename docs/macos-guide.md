# Clarity on macOS, Experimental

**Linux is the primary platform.** It's what's tested first, what ships fastest, and what the
rest of this README is written for. The macOS build is a second host in the same codebase,
real, working, and actively used, but younger, unsigned, and with less mileage behind it than Linux.
"Experimental" means exactly that: expect it to work for the things listed below as working, and
expect rough edges anywhere this guide doesn't mention.

If something breaks, [open an issue](https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/Clarity/issues),
macOS reports are genuinely useful right now, this build needs them.

## What works today

- **The full library**: Steam and GOG sign-in, sync, and browsing, all three faces (the
  Manager, Couch, and Installer)
- **Installing and launching Mac-native GOG games**, real downloads through `gogdl` directly,
  not a browser hand-off
- **Windows games, through CrossOver** *(new in 1.9)*, titles that only ship a Windows build are
  no longer off-limits. Clarity drives CrossOver directly, giving each game its own bottle
  under the same per-game scheme the Linux build uses: created once on first launch, reused after
  that, nothing to configure. Two caveats, both worth reading before you count on it. CrossOver is
  commercial software from CodeWeavers and **is not bundled**, you install it yourself, and
  without it this simply reports as unavailable. And while the plumbing is verified end to end,
  it has not been driven against a large library of real games yet, so **treat per-title
  compatibility as unproven**.
- **A filter for which of your games are actually Mac-native**, the "Mac-Native" option in the
  library's category dropdown, plus a small apple badge on the cover art of anything it applies
  to. GOG is checked instantly from what you already own; Steam needs one "Scan for Mac
  Compatibility" pass (Control Panel → search "mac native") since it's a live check per game
- Artwork, genres, playlists, save-game backups, themes, everything that isn't platform-specific
  works exactly like the Linux build, because almost all of the app *is* the same code

## What doesn't work yet

- **Epic sign-in.** Signing in to Epic doesn't hold on macOS yet, the browser-based approval
  completes, but the credentials never reach where `legendary` looks for them, so the Epic half
  of the library sync comes back empty. Steam and GOG are unaffected; until this lands, treat the
  macOS build as a Steam-and-GOG one. (Epic on Linux is fine. This is macOS-only.)
- **Anti-cheat.** BattlEye and EAC aren't wired up. CrossOver advertises its own support for
  both, but nothing here has been tested against a game that uses them, so assume multiplayer
  titles that depend on anti-cheat won't run.
- **A picker for which screen a game opens on.** KDE-only feature on Linux; no macOS equivalent
  exists yet.
- **Custom installers / source ports / mods** (Ironwail, GZDoom, the Build-engine games, etc.),
  the whole recipe catalogue is Linux-only for now.
- **An external-drive-aware install location.** Games install to `~/Games/Clarity` on your
  internal disk; pointing that at an external SSD works if you pick the folder yourself, but
  nothing in the app is aware of a drive being unplugged yet.

## Install

1. Download the `.dmg` (or the `.zip`) from the
   [1.9.0 release](https://github.com/FromChaosComesClarity/Clarity/releases/tag/v1.9.0), the
   macOS asset is separate from the Linux AppImage, and it sits on that release rather than the
   newest one. **The current macOS build is 1.9.0**; Linux has since had 1.9.1, a Linux-only fix
   that ships no Mac asset, so "latest release" won't have a `.dmg` in it.
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Clarity** into **Applications** (or, for the `.zip`, unzip it
   and move the `.app` there yourself).
3. **The build isn't signed**, no Apple Developer account behind it yet, so the very first
   launch needs one extra step. Pick whichever works on your macOS version:
   - **Right-click (or Control-click) the app → Open → Open.** This still works on most versions,
     though Apple has been tightening it release over release.
   - **If that option doesn't appear at all:** double-click normally, let it get blocked, then go
     to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** next to
     the message about Clarity. Confirm once more when it asks.
   - **From Terminal, if neither of the above shows anything:**
     ```sh
     xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Clarity.app"
     ```
     This strips the quarantine flag macOS attaches to anything downloaded from the internet,
     after that, it opens like any other app, every time.

   You only need to do this once per install. It's not a workaround for something broken, it's
   the standard cost of an app that hasn't gone through Apple's notarization process yet.

4. First launch walks you through connecting your stores, the same onboarding as the Linux
   build, though Epic sign-in won't stick yet (see above). Nothing here is mandatory; everything it offers also lives in the Control Panel later.

## Where things live

Everything is under `~/Library/Application Support/`:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Your library (games, artwork, playlists, settings) | `Clarity/GameManagerConfig/` |
| GOG/Epic install state, auth, launch logs | `Clarity/InstallerConfig/` |
| Installed games (default location) | `~/Games/Clarity/` |

Nothing is under `/Applications` except the app bundle itself, deleting the app and reinstalling
a new build never touches your library.

## If something looks wrong

- **A game the app thinks is installed won't launch, or shows a "not found" error it shouldn't.**
  This build occasionally ends up with two disagreeing copies of its GOG/Epic database if the
  standalone Installer window and the Manager have ever pointed at different files, a known,
  fixed-once-already class of bug. Quitting and reopening the app (Cmd+Q, not just closing the
  window) resolves it if it recurs; if it doesn't, that's worth reporting with the exact error
  text.
- **Nothing opens at all, silently.** Check Console.app (search for "Clarity") for a crash
  log, or run the app from Terminal directly to see errors live:
  ```sh
  "/Applications/Clarity.app/Contents/MacOS/Clarity"
  ```

## For anyone building from source

The developer-facing docs, architecture, the platform-backend design, exact phase-by-phase
history of what got built and why, live in `docs/mac-port-handoff.md` and
`docs/mac-port-phase-a.md` in this repo. Worth reading before touching the macOS-specific code;
several of the traps documented there cost real debugging time to find the first time.
