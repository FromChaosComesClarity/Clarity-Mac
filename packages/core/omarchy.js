// backend: `host.id` is still `linux` and every path in platform/linux.js applies unchanged.
// What is different is the *desktop*, a Wayland tiling compositor instead of KDE, and the
// fact that a fresh install ships almost none of the gaming stack, because Omarchy is aimed
// at developers first. Both of those are things this module can answer questions about.
//
// This file deliberately imports nothing from the rest of the suite: node builtins only. It
// is meant to be copied into EmuLatte verbatim, where only the wiring differs.
//
// ⚠️ Nothing here escalates privileges. Installing packages needs root, and the honest way
// to ask for root from a GUI app is to hand the command to a terminal the user can watch,
// see openInstallTerminal(). Omarchy's own guidance says the same: sudo where a terminal
// exists to type the password into.

// ── Window behaviour under Hyprland ──────────────────────────────────────────
// A tiling compositor tiles everything, including windows that are obviously transient. The
// Installer window is the clear case: it is a tool the Manager opens over itself, and tiling it
// side-by-side halves the library you were just looking at. Sign-in windows are the same
// shape. They are dialogs, and a dialog that steals half the screen is a dialog done wrong.
//
// ⚠️ Every face ships as the same Electron app, so they all share one app id
// (`clarity`). Class alone cannot tell them apart; the rules below match on TITLE, which
// is the only thing that distinguishes Installer from the Manager from Couch.
//
// Applied with `hyprctl keyword`, which is session-scoped and writes NOTHING to the user's
// Hyprland config, the same restraint kwin-display.js exercises on KDE, and for the same
// reason: a game launcher has no business editing someone's window manager configuration.
// Re-applied at every start, since the rules die with the session.
// ⚠️ Hyprland 0.56 with Omarchy's Lua config runs a NON-LEGACY parser, and `hyprctl keyword`
// simply does not work there, it answers "keyword can't work with non-legacy parsers. Use
// eval." and changes nothing. Worse, it answers that on stdout with exit status 0, so a naive
// success check counts the refusal as a success and reports rules applied that were not. The
// runtime API is `hyprctl eval` with Omarchy's own Lua helper:
//
//     o.window({ class = "...", title = "..." }, { float = true, center = true })
//
// A plain Arch box running Hyprland with a .conf config still has the legacy parser, so the
// keyword form is kept as a fallback. Both are checked for a literal "ok".
// Every window class a game can arrive under, as one Lua/Hyprland regex. Kept in step with
// kwin-display.js's GAME_CLASSES, the same problem on a different compositor.

// being squashed into half a screen.
//
// FLOATING was the old default and fixed that, but not the thing underneath it: a floating
// game opens at whatever size it decided on, which on a multi-monitor desk is frequently the
// wrong one. It then stays that size, so pressing the compositor's fullscreen key scales a
// small picture up rather than giving the game the screen.
//
// FULLSCREEN hands it the whole monitor at map time, which is what a game wants and what
// Omarchy's own rules already do for RetroArch and Moonlight. ⚠️ It also fullscreens a game's
// little pre-launch configuration dialog, since umu gives every Proton title the same window
// class and nothing distinguishes the two, which is exactly why floating remains one click
// away rather than being deleted.
//
// Same class list the KWin picker uses: everything through umu/Proton arrives as steam_app_*,
// and the rest are the runners the suite launches directly.

// ── Omarchy's own gaming installers ──────────────────────────────────────────

// is strictly better than installing the package ourselves: `steam` also pulls the 32-bit
// graphics drivers picked for *this* GPU, which is the step people miss and the reason a
// fresh Arch install runs Proton games at software-rendering speed or not at all.
//
// So the rule is: if Omarchy has an installer for it, hand the user Omarchy's installer.
// We detect what is missing and get out of the way. Nothing here is installed by us.
//
// ⚠️ These are whole applications, not helper binaries, a missing one is never an error,
// only an offer. Steam missing is worth surfacing prominently because the library is built
// from it; the rest are opportunities.
