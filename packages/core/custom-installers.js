// ── Custom installers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Fan games, source ports and custom engines, installed from the file the user already
// downloaded. Deliberately a catalogue of *specific* recipes rather than one clever
// generic importer: the folders these projects ship are not consistent enough for a
// heuristic to get right, and getting it wrong is invisible. Brutal Doom is the example
// that settles the argument, the .bat beside gzdoom.exe carries the whole mod command
// line, so a generic "find the exe" importer launches vanilla Doom and looks like it
// worked.
//
// Two halves, and only the second one is ours to be clever about:
//   1. The port itself, the user downloads it. We say exactly where to get it and what
//      the file is called, then identify and unpack whatever they hand us.
//   2. The game data. This is the part worth automating. A source port is useless
//      without id1/pak0.pak, and the user very likely already owns Quake in the library
//      CN is already managing. We find it and wire it up rather than asking.
